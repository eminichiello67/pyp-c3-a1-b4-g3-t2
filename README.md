# [pyp-c3-a1] Role-playing game

We're going to code a role-playing game similar to Rock-paper-scissors. But instead of playing with Rocks and Scissors we're going to use funnier things.

The game allows you to create a character and select different skills from the given character. Available skills are:
 * Super strength
 * Flying
 * Super speed

When you start the game you can choose **2 and only 2** skills. Once you've created your character the computer will generate a random character with 2 random skills. Then the game starts and both characters "fight". The winner will be decided based on the skills of the opponents. These are the rules:

* Strength wins over speed
* Flying wins over strength
* Speed wins over Flying

The game can be won, lost or tied based on the skills you've chosen and the ones randomly generated by the computer. Here you can see an example:

# Code

To code this game you'll need to use Multiple Inheritance or Mixins and (optionally) metaclasses. For example, skills will be encoded as classes:

```python
class FlyingTrait(GameCharacterTrait):
    pass


class SuperSpeedTrait(GameCharacterTrait):
    pass
```

And a character can be coded as a class that inherits from those classes:

```python
class Character(SuperSpeedTrait, FlyingTrait):
    pass
```

At any point a character will have a method `fight` that will be polymorphic and will receive other opponent. Example: `my_opponent.figth(computer_opponent)` The result of that operation will indicate which opponent won the fight.

# Extra

**More skills**

Try adding more skills to your game. This might be useful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game

**Different attacks**

Every skill can have different attacks. For example **Super Strength** can have __Power kick__ and __Power punch__ with different values and **Super Speed** can have __fast punch__ and __fast kick__. Now the rules are more complex, because __fast kick__ wins over __Power punch__. But using __fast kick__ can reduce your energy and the next attack can kill you.
