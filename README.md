# [pyp-c3-a1] Role-playing game

We're going to code a role-playing game similar to Rock-paper-scissors. But instead of playing with Rocks and Scissors we're going to use funnier things.

The game allows you to create a character and select different skills from the given character. Available skills are:
 * Super strength
 * Flying
 * Super speed

When you start the game you can choose **2 and only 2** skills. Once you've created your character the computer will generate a random character with 2 random skills. Then the game starts and both characters "fight". The winner will be decided based on the skills of the opponents. These are the rules:

* Strength wins over speed
* Flying wins over strength
* Speed wins over Flying

The game can be won, lost or tied based on the skills you've chosen and the ones randomly generated by the computer. Here you can see an example:
